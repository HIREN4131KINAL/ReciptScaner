Download Smart Receipts on the Google Play Store:
 
 - [Smart Receipts](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=wb.receipts). The free version of the app, but it also supports an in-app purchase subscription.
 - [Smart Receipts Plus](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=wb.receiptspro). A 'paid' app from back before Google supported in-app purchases.

The free and plus versions versions are identical, except the plus version offers the following enhancements:

- The plus version has no ads
- The plus version supports automatic backups (Android only - coming to iOS in the next update)
- The plus version automatically processes exchange rate conversions (with the newest version)
- The plus version allows you to edit/customize the pdf footer

## Install 

Smart Receipts is broken into a few core modules:

- SmartReceiptsFree. An 'application' module, which contains the free version of the app.
- SmartReceiptsPRO. An 'application' module, which contains the plus version of the app.
- SmartReceiptsLibrary. All common code between the free and plus versions of the app. Nearly all development work will occur in here
- WBMiniLibrary. A few legacy items that haven't been moved into the Library module, but it's otherwise unused.

To install, clone or pull down this project. Please note that it will **NOT** work out of the box, so you will need to add the following files to ensure it will compile (if desired):
  
- google-services.json. This needs to be added inside of [smartReceiptsFree](smartReceiptsFree/) and [smartReceiptsPlus](smartReceiptsPRO/) at it's root level in order for Firebase to function. Please [refer to the Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/) for more details.
- secrets.xml. You can copy the secrets.xml.sample file and rename the keys inside to achieve this behavior. This is used for low usage keys
- ads.xml. The ads file in smartReceiptsFree. You can add a key here if you wish to enable ads.
- analytics.xml. The analytics file in smartReceiptsFree. You can add a key here if you wish to enable Google Analytics.

Generally speaking, it's easier to test against SmartReceiptsPRO (ie Smart Receipts Plus app), since there are less dependencies that have been explicitly gitignored.
